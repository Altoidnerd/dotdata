# dotdata ML task

##Data Science Use Case

##Data
*	1. NYC taxi trip history data from 2015/01 – 2015/12
*	2. Daily weather data from 2015/01 – 2015/12
*	3. Public holiday data for the year of 2015

##Problem
Build an ML model to predict whether each trip has over 20% tip rate or not.

Expected outputs

*	1. Please submit the code you developed to build predictive model(s) as Jupyter notebook(s) on Python3 kernel.
*	2. Please summarize the key conclusion of your analysis. This report should include the following:
		a. The most significant features that affect each trip’s tip percentage.
		b. The performance of your predictive model(s), and suggest what additional dataset you’d like to include to improve the performance of your models.

###Note
*	Please assume the client wants to get the model with high prediction accuracy.
*	Please assume the code would be reviewed by your team members, and be further developed.
